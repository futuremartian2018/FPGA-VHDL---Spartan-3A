ADC Demo
--------
This demo shows how to connect the MCP3208 12 bit, 8 channel ADC
to the 8051/8052.

In this demo CH0 is connected to a 0 to +5V power supply and
CH1 is connected to a 0 to +24V powersupply using 19K and 5K
resistors to divide the voltage down to +5V output at +24V input.
A 100nF capacitor could be connected in parallel with the 5K resistor
to lower the output impedance.

A practical value of the resistors would be 15K and 3K9. In this case
the full scale reading would occure at:

Vx=Vref*(15+3.9)/3.9
Vx=5.0*(15+3.9)/3.9=24.23

FP24MUL=24.23/4095=0.0059169719

FP24MUL:	DB	7Eh,00h,19h,97h,16h,59h


The FP5MUL and FP24MUL constants was found using the Calc demo.
